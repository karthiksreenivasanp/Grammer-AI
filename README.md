# 📝 Grammer AI 

**Grammer AI** is a powerful, 100% offline NLP tool designed to "humanize" AI-generated text. Built on the **Qwen-2.5-3B** Large Language Model (LLM), it rewrites content with high perplexity and burstiness to effectively bypass AI detection filters like GPTZero and Turnitin.

## 🚀 Features

* **🛡️ Anti-Detection "Chaos Mode":** Uses specialized prompts to inject natural imperfections, varied sentence structures, and human-like flow.
* **⚡ Zero-Lag Performance:** Optimized for mid-range GPUs (e.g., RTX 2050/3050) using the lightweight but smart Qwen-2.5-3B model.
* **🔒 100% Privacy:** No data leaves your device. Everything runs locally using `llama-cpp-python`.
* **🎨 Pro CLI Interface:** A hacker-style, color-coded terminal UI with real-time progress tracking.
